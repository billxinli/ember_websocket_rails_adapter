#Ember Websocket Rails Adapter

This is a practice/demo/WIP Ember Data Adapter that uses Websocket, it was written while I was bored on vacation. This is no where near production ready and will never be. It is just an idea that I've been toying.

The general idea behind this adapter is to make all Ember data request via Websocket instead of HTTP requests.

It assumes that you uses Rails as the backend and uses Websocket-rails gem for websocket.

Maybe in the future I will implement a backend agnostic websocket adapter.
